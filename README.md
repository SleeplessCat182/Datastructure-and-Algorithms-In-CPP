# Data structures In CPP
This repo contains the source code of many data structure such as Linked List, Stack, Queue and the list goes on.
However please kindly use this as a reference only, the code here might contains bugs or not optimized.
If you find the way to optimize something, please pull request. 

For algorithms, it can be implemented in many different ways. This is just my style.

Thank you
